## Understanding AI Skills

### What are AI Skills?

AI Skills are markdown files (`SKILL.md`) that teach AI how to do specific tasks. Each skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter.

### Skill Structure

```
my-skill/
└── SKILL.md
```

**SKILL.md format:**

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: Summarizes long text into key points
---
# My Skill

## Instructions

Provide clear instructions for Claude...
```

### Skill Fields

- **name** (required): Skill identifier (lowercase, numbers, hyphens only, max 64 chars)
- **description** (required): What the skill does and when to use it (max 1024 chars)
- **content** (required): The markdown instructions that follow the frontmatter

## Creating Skills

### Via AI Chat

```
@ai-skills Create a skill called summarizer that summarizes long text into key points
```

The AI will ask for:

- **Name**: The skill identifier (lowercase with hyphens)
- **Description**: Clear description of what the skill does
- **Instructions**: The actual skill instructions in markdown

### Via Manage Skills UI

1. Open "Manage Skills" command
2. Press `Cmd + N` or click "+" button
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Skill Name**: lowercase-with-hyphens
   - **Description**: What the skill does
   - **Instructions**: The markdown instructions

## Example Skills

## Semantic Routing

The extension uses AI-powered semantic routing to automatically select the most relevant skill based on your request.

### How It Works

1. You ask: "Can you summarize this long article?"
2. The system analyzes your request
3. It compares against all enabled skills
4. Selects the best matching skill (e.g., "summarizer")
5. Applies that skill's instructions to your request

### Configuring the Routing Model

1. Open "Manage Skills" command
2. Click the gear icon (⚙️) or press `Cmd + M`
3. Select your preferred routing model
4. **Recommended models**:
   - Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite (fastest, free)
   - Claude 3.5/4.5 Haiku (fast, large context)
   - GPT-4o/5 Mini (fast and intelligent)

**Note**: Make sure your chosen model is enabled in Raycast AI settings.

## Skills Folders

### Default Locations

- **Personal**: `~/.claude/skills/`
- **Project**: `./.claude/skills/`

### Managing Folders

1. Open "Manage Skills" → Press `Cmd + F`
2. View all configured folders
3. Add new folders with `Cmd + N`
4. Edit folder paths with `Cmd + E`
5. Remove folders (must keep at least one)

**Use cases for multiple folders**:

- Separate personal and project-specific skills
- Team skills vs individual skills
- Different client projects
